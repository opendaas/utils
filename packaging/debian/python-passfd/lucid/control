Description: Python functions to pass file descriptors across UNIX domain sockets
 This simple extension provides two functions to pass and receive file
 descriptors across UNIX domain sockets, using the BSD-4.3+ sendmsg() and
 recvmsg() interfaces. Direct bindings to sendmsg() and recvmsg() are not
 provided, as the API does not map nicely into Python.
